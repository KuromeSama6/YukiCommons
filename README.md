# YukiCommons

A collection of utilities to help with Spigot/Bungeecord plugin development.

YukiCommons is in its very early stages and is currently under heavy development. YukiCommons is currently being used (and tested) under a non-professional production environment in a server that I own, but no guarantees about the plugin's performance or stability are made.

## Compatibility
As of the latest release, YukiCommons supports the following versions of Minecraft:

- Spigot (and its forks) 1.8.8; and
- Spigot (and its forks) 1.12.2; and
- Bungeecord (and its forks) 1.19-R0.1 and/or above.

YukiCommons is in theory compatible with all Spigot versions above and including 1.8.8, but only the above-listed Spigot versions have NMS support and have been tested.

## Dependencies

YukiCommons uses `PacketsEvents` for NMS packet handling.
This is an open source plugin, and can be found on GitHub.
